RPOGUENG - the testgame

which is populated with all sorts of creatures.

Your mission is to make the red hostile aliens

by hitting them... even to the death if needed.

To view the map, press 'm'. The map will show
areas you have explored. Areas with hostile 
aliens are shown in red. Press 'q' to quit.

Friendly green aliens will give you their HP
if you're wounded and they'll fight for you.
